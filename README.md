## Breast Cancer Prediction App
This is a web app based on machine learning which predicts breast cancer disease.

## Aim
The aim is of this web app is to predict whether the women is suffering from breast cancer or not that is based on texture,compactness,symmetry,fractional dimension mean values as well as using texture,smoothness,symmetry SE values and symmetry worst value.

## Module Used
Decision Tree Classifier is used for prediction of breast cancer.Random Forest Classifier is also applied. Adaboost and gradient classifier used for increasing accuracy. Flask is used for getting information from user and predicting it using the above model.It was deployed using heroku.

## Steps Performed
1. Select the approproate fields from the data.
2. Train model on the data.
3. Do some Hyperparameter tuning.
4. Save the model.
5. Deploy using flask frame-work.
